					<p>As Senior Program Advisor and Senior Civil Engineer for the USDA, Mr. Smoley developed engineering standards and provided master planning, facilities programming and design services for new wholesale
						produce markets, collection and shipping point markets, and farmers' markets facilities, nationwide and abroad, in conjunction with the Department's market feasibility studies.</p>
					<p>Wholesale, collection and shipping point markets projects included studies in Chicago, IL, Los Angeles, CA, Jackson, MS, Atlanta, GA, Thomasville, GA, Jessup, MD, and Benton Harbor, MI.</p>
					<p>Farmers' market projects included studies for Atlanta GA, Toledo OH, Covington KY, Columbia, MO, and Columbia, SC.</p>
					<p>Mr. Smoley worked on several development concept planning studies for adaptive reuse of older and historic structures for inner city public market facilities in Asheville, NC, Columbus, OH, Cincinnatti,
						OH, Toledo, OH, and Atlanta, GA. Work on historic structures often entails incorporating the design guidelines of the U. S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service Preservation Briefs.</p>
					<p>International work included market study and development proposals for projects in several Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
					<p>Recent SE&C projects included engineering and consulting services for assessment of hurricane damage and preparation of remediation proposals for agricultural and agribusiness related facilities and
						infrastructure on the islands of St. Kitts, Nevis and Antigua of the lower Carribean basin, in cooperation with the U.S. State Department's Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department
						of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service.</p>
					<p>We can provide market study, master planning and design services for any of these types of market facilities using a systems view approach that identifies the market facility as an interactive component
						of a larger and broader market system, and culminates in a design that acknowledges its participatory role.</p>
					<p>We can also develop alternative design concepts, site layouts and project cost pro-formas to optimize facilities operations with effective handling and distribution practices and technologies. Let
						us put this experience to work for you.</p>

				<div class="card hide" id="public_education">
					<p>As the Director of Facilities Management for a large scale independent school district, Mr. Smoley managed a facilities portfolio that included over 4,400,000 square feet of building space, including
						over 54 elementary, middle and high schools, special education and support facilities, an administration building complex, maintenance, warehouse and textbook facilities, transportation center, CNG
						bus refueling station, athletic stadiums and fieldhouse facilities.</p>
					<p>He coordinated the planning and implementation of a $79,000,000 capital improvement program of new construction, renovation and retrofit projects. Typical projects included new school facilities,
						renovations to older facilities, classroom additions, roof replacements, utility services replacements, HVAC system retrofits, parking lots, stadium athletic surfaces and seating replacements.</p>
					<p>From that personal hands on experience, coupled with the formal engineering training, comes a unique perspective that views both the ongoing management of school facilities and their capital improvement
						programs as components of a broader and more comprehensive system that must accommodate the anticipated growth and demographic changes, satisfy the current operational needs, and function within
						the framework of available funding resources to be truly effective.</p>
					<p>We can provide various services to help you plan, develop, organize and manage your capital improvement projects, including new construction, renovation and retrofit projects. These services may include
						facilities condition assessments, coordination of design and construction services, from initial site development, through construction, initial occupancy, and final project completion. Let us put
						our experience to work for you.</p>

						and replication of historic windows, doors, siding, moldings and trim, painting and roofing.</p>
					<p>Another project was the exterior restoration of the Frederick County Historical Society Building, Frederick, MD, a circa 1820 federal style building, including masonry repair, repointing, window and
						shutter repairs, and painting.</p>
					<p>Mr. Smoley also prepared conceptual plans, specifications and construction cost estimates for mixed use redevelopment of several historic building structures in the Carroll Creek area of downtown
						Frederick, MD.</p>
					<p>We can provide various planning, design and estimating services to introduce new uses for older and historic buildings to help owners address the needs and changing economics of inner city business
						climates.
